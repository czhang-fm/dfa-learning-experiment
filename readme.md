# some very short introduction

This repository explores DFA learning solutions. DFA learning from examples is supposed to be hard, because it's a known NP-hard problem in general, unless the training samples follow a very restrictive format. 
In this project, we first follow the algorithmic framework as introduced in the final report of Abbadingo One competition as published in ICGI-98 (https://abbadingo.cs.nuim.ie/).
We will later explore and compare with other solutions, such as reduction to a SAT-solver.
